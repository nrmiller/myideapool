## About the Project

This project was completed as a code challenge to demonstrate writing a web backend in C#. The goal was to write a RESTful API for signining in users with token-based authentication (JWT) and creating a minimal persistence layer to access and manage user data (in this case, ideas).

The approach behind the project was to use ASP.NET Core so that the backend could be deployed on any OS. Along with ASP.NET Core, Entity Framework Core was used for the persistence layer and object-relational mapper.
